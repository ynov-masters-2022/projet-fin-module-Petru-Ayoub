## Concepts
This is an introduction to a basic React App, featuring some basic React concepts.
### Project Structure
The project contains 3 main sections:

 - Views
 - Components
 - Services

The views are the pages displayed in the browser, the components are reusable HTML 'templates' that can be called in any page and the services, in this case, are the API calls which return data.

## Routing
Routing is managed by the react-router-dom lib.
The the routes are defined in app.js

Here, we have 3 main routes: the homepage (default route), heroes and comics which display a view showcasing a list of heroes and comics respectively.
We can also find routes params, notably hero/:id and comics/:id, where :id is a variable  containing the unique ID of an hero or comic. This routes return a details page for any given hero / comic. 
The ID is specified via a the `<Link>` tag.

This ID is then retrived from the details view using the `useParams()` hook.

We can then fetch the details using this ID.

The wildcard (*) route returns a "Not found" page if the specified route is not one of the availble routes.
